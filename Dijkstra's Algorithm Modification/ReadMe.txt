This folder is for an assignment called Dijkstra's Algorithm Modification

The goal was to analyze Dr. Stephany's code and understand it enough to adjust it to work with a linked list rather than a priority queue.

Main.cpp was the original file by Dr. Stephany.

My file is linkedlistdjikstra.cpp and it is loosely based on the original code and was aided by phind (AI)
